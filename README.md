The Investigate a data set project was the first investigative project done in the course which explored Data wrangling and exploratory data analysis. In this project I used a dataset which contained European soccer data. 
The datasets used in this project reside in a database with 7 tables (listed below), which have data on the European Soccer leagues:

<li> Country </li>
<li> League </li>
<li> Match </li>
<li> Player </li>
<li> Player_Attributes </li>
<li> Team </li>
<li> Team Attributes </li>
The data in the tables includes 25,000 matches, 11,000 players, 11 European leagues, covering seasons (2008 to 2016), players and teams and their attributes. Some of the data includes details on matches played, goals scored (by home and away teams), penalties, other player statistics, and betting odds by betting providers. Once I familiarized myself with the data, I focused on the data that will contribute the most to what I would like to report on. SQLite database was used to load the data initially and then they were programmatically accessed using Python to pull the data into dataframes. Other tasks beyond this consisted of assessing, and cleaning the data, then exploring the data and providing visuals of insights. The Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb has the steps taken in this project in more detail.
