The Investigate a data set project was the first investigative project done in the course which explored Data wrangling and exploratory data analysis. In this project I used a dataset which contained European soccer data. 
It contained tables which included data on 25,000 soccer matches, 10,000 players, 11 European leagues, over seasons (2008 to 2016) and Players and Teams and attributes. Some of the
data includes details on match events, possessions, fouls, possessions, as well as betting odds by betting providers. Before pulling the data into dataframes, I loaded them into 
SQLite database tables for an initial assessment of the data.
